      <h2>Programming</h2>
      <p class="lead">Programming is intense - whether done as a hobby: to prepare to launch a startup or build a portfolio, or at your day job.If someone is implying one does simpler things as a hobbyist, today’s software is very complex and demanding. The time of simple websites (“social networks”, whatever) is gone. WordPress is not programming (if that was meant by “coding”). So even if you want to develop a mobile app for yourself, it should be 100% industrial-quality work. The world doesn’t need more amateur stuff like PHP blog platforms. It desperately needs products freelancers cannot build.</p>
      <p class="lead">Like many other intense hobbies e.g. club racing, programming is not something you can learn over the weekend and “play with”. A hobby is a good way to discover your passion. But one like programming, is meaningless without the goal of going pro - to be paid like a pro.</p>
      <p class="lead">Admittedly though, the list of tips in this article is somewhat long and it takes time to develop new habits. And while eating healthy, sleeping well, exercising and taking care of yourself in other ways will help you feel better, perform better at your job and keep the love you once had for programming burning, it comes down to basics for most programmers.

        And that requires getting a life. Don’t masturbate yourself mentally thinking you must work 10 hours/day, 6 days/week. It’s scientifically proven that output decreases drastically after certain number of hours of focused work. Thus be focused and effective while you are working by using Pomodoro technique, and then switch off completely after work. Learn to say no and do something you love besides programming. That’s really the tip #1, and will always stay this way.</p>

          <p class="lead">The term information technology was coined by the Harvard Business Review, in order to make a distinction between purpose-built machines designed to perform a limited scope of functions and general-purpose computing machines that could be programmed for various tasks. As the IT industry evolved from the mid-20th century, computing capability advanced while device cost and energy consumption fell lower, a cycle that continues today when new technologies emerge.</p>
          <p class="lead">IT includes several layers of physical equipment <strong>(hardware)</strong>, virtualization and management or automation tools, operating systems and applications <strong>(software)</strong> used to perform essential functions. User devices, peripherals and software, such as laptops, smartphones or even recording equipment, can be included in the IT domain. IT can also refer to the architectures, methodologies and regulations governing the use and storage of data.</p>
