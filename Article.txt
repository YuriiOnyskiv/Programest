Programming is intense - whether done as a hobby: to prepare to launch a startup or build a portfolio, or at your day job.If someone is implying one does simpler things as a hobbyist, today’s software is very complex and demanding. The time of simple websites (“social networks”, whatever) is gone. WordPress is not programming (if that was meant by “coding”). So even if you want to develop a mobile app for yourself, it should be 100% industrial-quality work. The world doesn’t need more amateur stuff like PHP blog platforms. It desperately needs products freelancers cannot build.

Like many other intense hobbies e.g. club racing, programming is not something you can learn over the weekend and “play with”. A hobby is a good way to discover your passion. But one like programming, is meaningless without the goal of going pro - to be paid like a pro.
